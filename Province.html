	<h1>History</h1>
	<h4>Iloilo is a city in the Philippines that traces its history back to pre-colonial times as the center of Madja-as. The city originated from the town of Oton, an outpost founded by Spanish conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. Raids by Chinese and Moro pirates forced the relocation of the outpost to Villa Rica de Arevalo (present-day Arevalo). Iloilo was the second Spanish colonial center after Cebu in the Philippine Islands, and was founded in 15662. It was one of the royal Spanish cities in the Philippines in the Spanish East Indies.</h4>
	<h4>ILOILO takes its name from Irong-Irong, the old name of the city of Iloilo, a tongue of land that sticks out like a nose on the south of Iloilo River. The Maragtas Legend tells the story of Iloilo way back in the 13th century, when Datu Puti and his fellow Datus, fled from the tyranny of Sultan Makatunao of Borneo and landed at the mouth of the Siwaragan River, now known as the town of San Joaquin, and eventually settled there.</h4>
	<h4>At that time, people called the "Atis", who were ruled by King Marikudo and Queen Maniwangtiwang, inhabited Panay. King Marikudo bartered the lowlands of Panay Island for a golden hat, "saduk", and a long gold necklace, "manangyad", and other assorted gifts to the Bornean Datus. The latter then took complete control of the island with the "Atis" retiring to the mountains. It was Datu Paiburong who was assigned in Irong-Irong. Panay Island was ruled under the Code of Kalantiao, where peace and prosperity reigned for 300 years. But this was disrupted when the Spaniards came and established the provincial government.</h4>
